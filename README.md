# Railway Tampering & Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
Our solution is a **Meta-Model–based Mixture-of-Experts architecture** designed for real-time detection of anomalies and intentional track tampering across large rail networks. By fusing structural, visual, thermal, and contextual evidence, the system performs geo-referenced anomaly analysis, pinpoints affected track segments and hotspots, and generates actionable outputs including real-time alerts, visualizations, and operational action reports.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Real-Time Anomaly & Tampering Detection
Continuous monitoring enables early detection of abnormal vibrations, structural deviations, thermal hotspots, foreign object presence, and unauthorized human activity before these escalate into safety-critical incidents.

### Real-Time Alerts with Geo-Referenced Visualization
All detections are geo-tagged and visualized on a map-based interface, highlighting impacted zones and hotspots. Alerts and notifications are pushed in real time to support rapid, localized response.

### Automated Action Report Generation & Intelligent Routing
Instead of raw alerts, the system generates structured action reports detailing the nature of the anomaly, affected locations, severity, and recommended next steps such as inspections, speed restrictions, or patrol deployment. 
*   **Smart Rerouting**: The system provides intelligent rerouting suggestions to optimize network flow and minimize disruption during detected tampering events.

### Multi-Sensor, Multi-Stream Intelligence
The system seamlessly handles diverse input streams: geometric sensors, accelerometers, DAS, CCTV, drones, thermal cameras, and LiDAR without requiring uniform coverage. Each modality contributes complementary evidence, enabling reliable detection even when some sensors are unavailable.

### Comprehensive Tampering Analysis
The system detects intentional track tampering by correlating structural, vibration, visual, and thermal cues. It identifies scenarios such as:
*   Component manipulation
*   Foreign object placement
*   Rail cutting
*   Ballast disturbance
*   Signaling or cable tampering

## 🌟 Unique Selling Points (USP)

### 1. Evidence-Driven Mixture-of-Experts Architecture
Unlike monolithic models, the system dynamically selects expert reasoning paths based on available evidence, enabling robustness, scalability, and explainability across large rail networks.

### 2. Operationally Actionable Outputs
The system goes beyond detection by generating clear action reports, mitigation steps, and **rerouting suggestions** that align with real railway operations.

### 3. Deep Geo-Spatial Intelligence
All anomalies are geo-referenced, enabling precise localization, hotspot identification, and impact assessment across vast and distributed infrastructure.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Friendly Design
Natural language queries, visual explanations, and contextual reasoning make the system usable by operators without requiring ML expertise.

### 5. Designed for Sparse, Real-World Deployments
The architecture assumes imperfect sensor coverage and varying data quality, making it practical for nationwide railway adoption rather than controlled environments.
